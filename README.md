For this project, I've use what I learned from this tutorial (https://learnopengl.com/Lighting/Basic-Lighting) to implement a few things related to lighting. 
There are two cubes in the window. One is an object, and the other is a light source. You can rotate the object with WASD, and then you can move the light 
source around with arrow keys and left alt/spacebar. Also, you can adjust the RGB values for the object and light with the keys 4-9 and R-O. This lets you
see how different light colors influence the appearance of an object of different colors. If you're interested, just mess around with controls.
